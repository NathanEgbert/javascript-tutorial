Lessons for learning javascript

## Class 1 - Getting started
We will be setting up our environment and tutorial project to start developing 

### Environment setup
- install git
- install node.js (LTS version, v6.x.x)
- install your favorite IDE such as WebStorm

### Project setup
- fork repo
- clone forked version of repo
- npm install
- npm test

If after running npm test you should see something like this:

```
  0001 - example
    example.js
      âˆš should output "hello world" in the console (206ms)


  1 passing (214ms)

```

if you get an error it probably means you did not set something up correctly.
