Lessons for learning javascript

## Class 1 - Getting started
We will be setting up our environment and tutorial project to start developing 

### Environment setup
- install git
- install node.js (Latest version, v7.x.x)
- update npm (after installing node) `npm install -g npm`
- install your favorite IDE such as WebStorm

### Project setup
- fork repo
- clone forked version of repo
- npm install
- npm test

If after running npm test you should see something like this:

```
  0001 - example
    example.js
      âˆš should output "hello world" in the console (206ms)


  1 passing (214ms)

```

if you get an error it probably means you did not set something up correctly.

### Extra credit
In WebStorm setup a mocha run configuration to be able to run your unit tests in debug mode and add break points.

This step is not required but is highly recommended to facilitate you with developing.
